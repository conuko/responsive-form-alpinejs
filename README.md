# A responsive from with GRID and ALPINE JS

This form was created with HTML, CSS GRID and ALPINE JS with a mobile first approach. It can be used as standalone Form or inside an iFrame.

## Alpine JS

For more information about Alpine JS check out the following link:

## iFrame Resizer

I use the iframe-resizer from David J Bradshaw to enable the automatic resizing of the height and width of both same and cross domain iFrames to fit their contained content.
